# QuantumDice

So far without IBM Quantum API, because of up to 7 minutes waiting time in the job queue!!!

As an alternative to IBM, the Built-In Library [secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) is used:

"The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets."
